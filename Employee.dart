/*
Employees
a. Create a class called Employee that includes three pieces of information as
instance variablesâ€”a first name (typeString), a last name (typeString) and a
monthly salary (double).
b. Your class should have a constructor that initializes the three instance variables.
c. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. If the monthly salary is
not positive, set it to 0.0.
